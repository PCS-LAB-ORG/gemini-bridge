"""
gemini_bridge/tools/review.py
------------------------------
MCP tool: gemini_review — critical code and design review.

Responsibilities:
  - Register the gemini_review MCP tool with the server
  - Accept content (code/design/plan) + optional focused question and thinking level
  - Return Gemini's critical, severity-prioritized review

Design notes:
  - Single Responsibility: tool registration + review persona only
  - Open/Closed: system prompt changes do not affect other tools
  - System prompt: pessimistic, rigorous — finds problems and prioritizes by severity

Used by:  tools/__init__.py -> register_review(), server.py (via tools/__init__)
Imports:  tools/base.py (call_gemini), client.py (GeminiClient), transcript.py (TranscriptWriter)
