gemini_bridge/tools/brainstorm.py
----------------------------------
MCP tool: gemini_brainstorm — divergent ideation and devil's advocate thinking.

Responsibilities:
  - Register the gemini_brainstorm MCP tool with the server
  - Accept topic + optional context and thinking level
  - Return Gemini's divergent, challenge-first brainstorming response

Design notes:
  - Single Responsibility: tool registration + brainstorm persona only
  - Open/Closed: system prompt changes do not affect other tools
  - System prompt: unconventional, challenges current direction, plays devil's advocate

Used by:  tools/__init__.py -> register_brainstorm(), server.py (via tools/__init__)
Imports:  tools/base.py (call_gemini), client.py (GeminiClient), transcript.py (TranscriptWriter)
