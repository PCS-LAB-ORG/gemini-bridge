"""
gemini_bridge/tools/architect.py
---------------------------------
MCP tool: gemini_architect — system design and tradeoff analysis.

Responsibilities:
  - Register the gemini_architect MCP tool with the server
  - Accept system description + optional focused question and thinking level
  - Return Gemini's opinionated architecture guidance with explicit tradeoffs

Design notes:
  - Single Responsibility: tool registration + architect persona only
  - Open/Closed: system prompt changes do not affect other tools
  - System prompt: opinionated when a clearly better path exists; names tradeoffs explicitly

Used by:  tools/__init__.py -> register_architect(), server.py (via tools/__init__)
Imports:  tools/base.py (call_gemini), client.py (GeminiClient), transcript.py (TranscriptWriter)
